# TiPhysics
A Ti-84 helper/notes program I wrote to help me memorize formulas for my AP-Physics E&amp;M and Mechanics class 
## What language did I use?
TI - BASIC and BASIC were the main languages used to make this program, however, it can be made with simple Python and Lua scripting, meaning these programs can be ported to more advanced versions of Texas Instrument caluclators, specifically Ti-NSpire which provides excellent support for Python, Lua, and even C++. Within the folder is a *TiPhysics.8xp* file and *TiPhysics.txt* file. The text file is for you to edit my code freely as you wish and honestly it can be improved greatly. The .8xp file is provided so you can easily place the file within your calculator, I recommend you place it in the Ti-84 RAM. THIS ONLY WORKS WITH Ti-83 -> Ti-84 plus CE.
## Where did I get these formulas?
All formulas presented were given to me by my physics teacher and his excellent AP Phyiscs notes I used during class, all credit goes towards him for these formulas as some of these formulas are not given in standard text books and will work in any standard college or AP class. Thanks Dr. M.
